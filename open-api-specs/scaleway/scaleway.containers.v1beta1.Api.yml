  description: |-
    Scaleway Serverless Containers is a «Container As A Service» product which gives users the ability to deploy atomic serverless workloads and only pay for resources used while containers are running.

    It provides many advantages, such as:

    - Containers are only executed when an event is triggered, which allows users to save money while code is not running
    - Auto-Scalability:
      - Automated `Scaling up and down` based on user configuration (e.g. min: 0, max: 100 replicas of my container).
      - Automated `Scaling to zero` when a container is not executed, which is cost-effective for the user and saves computing resources for the cloud provider.
    - Endpoint-only scaling

    ### Serverless Framework

    This page explains how to use the Scaleway Containers API, including a quickstart and the full API documentation. However, you may prefer to use the
    [Serverless Framework plugin](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions) enabling users to deploy their serverless workloads
    much more easily with a single `serverless deploy` command.

    If what you are looking for is an easy way to deploy your code, you may prefer Serverless Framework.

    Below, you will find a step-by-step guide on how to create a `namespace`, configure and deploy `containers`, and trigger your `containers` via HTTP and CRON.

    ## Concepts

    Refer to our [dedicated concepts page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/containers/concepts/) to find definitions of the different terms referring to Serverless Containers.
    ## Quickstart

    1. Configure your environment variables.
        ```bash
        export $SCW_SECRET_KEY="<Secret key of your token>"
        export SCW_DEFAULT_REGION="<Choose your location (pl-waw/nl-ams/fr-par)>"
        export SCW_PROJECT_ID="<Your Project ID>"
        ```
        <Message type="tip">
          This is an optional step that seeks to simplify your usage of the Serverless Containers API. See [Regions](#availability-zones) below for help choosing a region. You can find your Project ID in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/Project/settings).
        </Message>

    2. Set the name for your namespace and configure your Project ID:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://api.scaleway.com/containers/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/namespaces" \
          -H "accept: application/json" \
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d "{
              \"name\": \"your-namespace-name\", \
              \"project_id\": \"$SCW_PROJECT_ID\", \
              \"environment_variables\": {\"YOUR_VARIABLE\": \"content\"} \
              }"
        ```

    3. **Copy the response's `id` field**, you will need it for the next steps. For the sake of simplicity, we will save the ID to a variable, which will be used in the following examples:
        ```bash
        export NAMESPACE_ID="<your namespace id>"
        ```
        <Message type="note">
          We suppose you already have a working image here. It can be anything which listens on a env variable \$PORT variable. Note that we run your container as user 1000, not root, so it must be runnable under these conditions.
          For more information on how to push your image, refer to the [Container Registry documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/developers/api/registry/).
        </Message>

    4. **Edit the POST request payload** to use in the next step to create an Elastic Metal server. Modify the values in the example according to your requirements, using the information in the payload values section to help. For container resource criteria and default values, please refer to the [Containers Limitation documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/).

    ## Technical information

    A **Container** in Scaleway Containers consists of multiple components:

    - **Environment variables**: Users may configure specific environment variables (Database host/credentials for example) which are safely encrypted in our Database, and will be mounted inside your containers. **Note** that environment variables set at `namespace` level will also be mounted (in every container). Environment variables written at `container` level override the ones set at `namespace` level (if two of them bear the same name for example).
    - **Docker image**: A Docker image contains all the elements required to run your software: code, a runtime environment, tools, scripts, libraries, etc.
    - **Resources**: Users may decide how much computing resource to allocate to each container -> `Memory Limit` (in MB). We will then allocate the right amount of `CPU` based on Memory Limit choice. The right choice for your container's resources is very important, as you will be billed based on compute usage over time and the number of Containers executions.

    ### Product features
    - Fully isolated environments
    - Scaling to zero (saves money and computing resources while the code is not executed)
    - High Availability and scalability (automated and configurable, each container may scale automatically according to incoming workloads)
    - Multiple event sources:
      - HTTP (request on our gateway will execute the container)
      - CRON (time-based job, runs according to configurable cron schedule)
    - Integrated to the Scaleway Container Registry product:
      - Deploy any docker image from one of your registry namespace
    - Flexible resources: you can choose values separately for your memory and CPU within a range in respect with maximum and minimum allowed values in [Containers Limitation documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/).

    ### Regions

    Serverless Containers is available in the Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw regions, which are represented by the following path parameters:

    * `fr-par`
    * `nl-ams`
    * `pl-waw`

    ### CRON

    A `CRON` is a type of event which triggers a Scaleway Container: it is an `add-on` to your container.

    CRONs inside Scaleway Containers have the following properties:

    - `schedule`: UNIX Formatted CRON schedule. Your container will be executed based on this schedule. For example, `5 4 * * 0` means "execute my container at 04:05 AM every Sunday" (see this [page from Ubuntu's official documentation](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/cron)). The timezone is UTC+0.
    - `args`: JSON object passed to your container. You can use this property to define data that will be passed to your container's `event.body` object. For Containers, you might handle these arguments as the HTTP request's body.

    Under the hood, CRON Triggers are [Kubernetes JOBs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) sending HTTP POST requests to your container.

    ### Authentication

    By default new containers are `public` meaning that no credentials are required to invoke them.

    A container can be `private` or `public`. This can be configured through the `privacy` parameter.

    Calling a `private` container without authentication will return HTTP code `403`.

    ### Logs

    Containers logs are sent to the project's [Cockpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/).

    The **Serverless Containers Logs** dashboard in Grafana can be used to see containers logs. More complex queries can be done using the "Explore" section of Grafana, and LogQL queries:

    ```logql
    {resource_type="serverless_container"}
    ```

    Additionally, the loki endpoint (`https://logs.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud`) can be used to query programmatically the containers logs using a [token](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token/).
