  description: |-
    Scaleway Instances are virtual machines in the cloud. Different [Instance types](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) offer different technical specifications in terms of vCPU, RAM, bandwidth and storage. Once you have created your Instance and installed your image of choice (e.g. an operating system), you can [connect to your Instance via SSH](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) to use it as you wish. When you are done using the Instance, you can delete it from your account.

    ## Quickstart

    1. Configure your environment variables

        <Message type="note">
        This is an optional step that seeks to simplify your usage of the Instances API. See [Availability Zones](#availability-zones) below for help choosing an Availability Zone. You can find your Project ID in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/project/settings).
        </Message>

        ```bash
        export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<API secret key>"
        export SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE="<Scaleway Availability Zone>"
        export SCW_PROJECT_ID="<Scaleway Project ID>"
        ```

    2. **Create an Instance**: Run the following command to create an Instance. You can customize the details in the payload (name, description, type, tags etc) to your needs: use the information below to adjust the payload as necessary.

        ```bash
        curl -X POST \
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/servers" \
            -d '{
              "name": "my-new-instance",
              "project": "'"$SCW_PROJECT_ID"'",
              "commercial_type": "GP1-S",
              "image": "ubuntu_noble",
              "enable_ipv6": true,

                }
              }
            }'
        ```

        ```

    4. **Delete an Instance**: run the following command to delete an Instance, specified by its Instance ID:

        ```bash
        curl -X DELETE \
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \

    ### Availability Zones

    Instances can be deployed in the following Availability Zones:

    | Name      | API ID                |
    |-----------|-----------------------|
    | Paris     | `fr-par-1` `fr-par-2` `fr-par-3` |
    | Amsterdam | `nl-ams-1` `nl-ams-2` `nl-ams-3` |
    | Warsaw    | `pl-waw-1` `pl-waw-2` `pl-waw-3` |

    (switchcolumn)
    (switchcolumn)

    ### Pagination

    Most listing requests receive a paginated response. Requests against paginated endpoints accept two `query` arguments:

    - `page`, a positive integer to choose which page to return.
    - `per_page`, an positive integer lower or equal to 100 to select the number of items to return per page. The default value is `50`.

    Paginated endpoints usually also accept filters to search and sort results.These filters are documented along each endpoint documentation.

    The `X-Total-Count` header contains the total number of items returned.

    ### Creating an Instance: the volumes object

    When [creating an Instance](#path-instances-create-an-instance) using the Scaleway API, the `volumes` object is **not strictly required**. However, the defaults vary depending on certain conditions:

    1. If an image label is used:
       - The default will be an `sbs_volume` volume.
       - The size of this volume will be the OS size (typically 10GB in most cases).

    2. If an image ID from the marketplace is used:
       - If the Instance supports local storage:
         - The default will be an `l_ssd` volume.
         - The size of this volume will be the instance's maximum local storage capacity.
       - Else, the volume created will depend on the marketplace's local_image type:
         - SBS volume for instance_sbs type.
         - l_ssd volume for instance_local type.

    If you want to customize the storage configuration or add additional volumes, you will need to include the volumes object in your API request. This object should contain at least one (dictionary) object with a minimum of one key (`"0"`) whose value is another object containing the parameters `"name"` (a name for the volume), `"size"` (the size for the volume, in bytes), and `"volume_type"` (`"sbs_volume"` or `"l_ssd"`). Additional keys for additional volumes should increment by 1 each time (the second volume would have a key of `"1"`.)

    Note that volume `size` must respect the volume constraints of the Instance's `commercial_type`: for each type of Instance, a minimum amount of storage is required, and there is also a maximum that cannot be exceeded. All Instance types support Block Storage (`sbs_volume`), some also support local storage (`l_ssd`). Read more about these constraints in the [List Instance types](#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) documentation, specifically the `volume_constraints` parameter for each type listed in the response

    You can use the `volumes` object in different ways. The table below shows which parameters are required for each of the following use cases:

    | Use case                | Required params       | Optional params     | Notes                                  |
    |-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
    | Create a volume (`l_ssd`, `sbs_volume`) from a snapshot of an image  |  | `volume_type`, `size`, `boot` | If the `size` parameter is not set, the size of the volume will equal the size of the corresponding snapshot of the image. The image snapshot type should be compatible with the `volume_type`. |
    | Create a volume (`l_ssd`) from a snapshot     | `base_snapshot`, `name`, `volume_type` | `boot` |  |
    | Create a volume of type `sbs_volume` from a snapshot     | `base_snapshot`, `name`, `volume_type` | `size`, `boot` |  |
    | Create an empty volume      | `name`, `volume_type`, `size` | `boot` |  |
    | Attach an existing volume (`l_ssd`)  | `id` | `boot` |  |
    | Attach an existing volume of type `sbs_volume`   | `id`, `volume_type` | `boot` |  |

- name: Instances
  description: |
    Instances are computing units providing resources to run your applications on.
    Scaleway offers various Instance types including **Virtual Instances** and **dedicated GPU Instances**.
    **Note: Instances can be referenced as "servers" in API endpoints.**
- name: Images
  description: |
    Images are backups of your Instances.
    One image will contain all the volumes of your Instance and can be used to restore your Instance and its data. You can also use it to create a series of Instances with a predefined configuration.
    To copy not all but only one specified volume of an Instance, you can use the snapshot feature instead.
- name: Security Groups
  description: |
    A security group is a set of firewall rules on a set of Instances.
    Security groups enable you to create rules that either drop or allow incoming traffic from certain ports of your Instances.

    Security groups are stateful by default which means return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules.
    As a contrary, you have to switch in a stateless mode to define explicitly allowed.
- name: User Data
  description: |
    User data is a key/value store you can use to provide your instance with introspective data.

    As an example of use, Scaleway images contain the `scw-generate-ssh-keys` script, which generates the SSH server’s host keys, then stores their fingerprints as user data under the `ssh-host-fingerprints` key.
    This way, before connecting to the instance using SSH, one can query the fingerprints to ensure that the remote host is the expected one, thus avoiding any man-in-the-middle attack.

    There are two ways of accessing user data:
     - **From within a running Instance**, by requesting the Metadata API at http://169.254.42.42/user_data (or http://[fd00:42::42]/user_data using IPv6).
       The `scaleway-ecosystem` package, installed by default on all OS images provided by Scaleway, ships with the `scw-userdata` helper command that allows you to easily query the user data from the instance.
       For security reasons, viewing and editing user data is only allowed to queries originating from a port below 1024 (by default, only the super-user can bind to ports below 1024).
       To specify the source port with cURL, use the `--local-port` option (e.g. `curl --local-port 1-1023 http://169.254.42.42/user_data`).
     - **From the Instance API** by using the methods described below.
- name: Instance Types
  description: |
    All Instance types available in a specified zone.
    Each type contains all the features of the Instance (CPU, RAM, Storage) as well as their associated pricing.
- name: Volume Types
  description: |
    All volume types available in a specified zone.
    Each of these types will contains all the capabilities and constraints of the volume (min size, max size, snapshot).
- name: IPs
  description: |
    A flexible IP address is an IP address which you hold independently of any Instance.
    You can attach it to any of your Instances and do live migration of the IP address between your Instances.

    Note that attaching a flexible IP address to an Instance removes its previous public IP and interrupts any ongoing public connection to the Instance. This does not apply if you have migrated your server to the new Network stack and have at least one flexible IP attached to the Instance.
- name: Volumes
  description: |
    A volume is where you store your data inside your Instance. It
    appears as a block device on Linux that you can use to create
    a filesystem and mount it.

    The Instance API only supports local (`l_ssd`) and `scratch` volume types.
    Block storage volumes can also be attached to Instances, these volumes are
    managed by the SBS API (https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/).

    Minimum and maximum volume sizes for each volume types can be queried
    from the zone `/products/volumes` API endpoint. _I.e_ for:
      - `fr-par-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/products/volumes
      - `nl-ams-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/nl-ams-1/products/volumes

    Each type of volume is also subject to a global quota for the sum of all the
    volumes. This quota depends of the level of support and may be
    changed on demand.

    When using multiple block devices, it's advised to mount them by
    using their UUID instead of their device name. A device name is
    subject to change depending on the volumes order. Block devices
    UUIDs can be found in `/dev/disk/by-id/`.
- name: Snapshots
  description: |
    Snapshots contain the data of a specified volume at a particular point in time.
    The data can include the Instance's operating system,
    configuration information and/or files stored on the volume.

    A snapshot can be done from a specified volume, e.g. you
    have one Instance with a volume containing the OS and another one
    containing the application data, and you want to use different
    snapshot strategies on both volumes.

    Volumes can be created from snapshots of their own type.
- name: Placement Groups
  description: |
    Placement groups allow the user to express a preference regarding
    the physical position of a group of Instances. The feature lets the user
    choose to either group Instances on the same physical hardware for
    best network throughput and low latency or to spread Instances across
    physically distanced hardware to reduce the risk of physical failure.

    The operating mode is selected by a `policy_type`. Two policy
    types are available:
      - `low_latency` will group Instances on the same hypervisors
      - `max_availability` will spread Instances across physically distanced hypervisors

    The `policy_type` is set to `max_availability` by default.

    For each policy types, one of the two `policy_mode` may be selected:
      - `optional` will start your Instances even if the constraint is not respected
      - `enforced` guarantees that if the Instance starts, the constraint is respected

    The `policy_mode` is set by default to `optional`.
- name: Private NICs
  description: |
    A Private NIC is the network interface that connects an Instance to a
    Private Network. An Instance can have multiple private NICs at the same
    time, but each NIC must belong to a different Private Network.

      summary: Get a volume or snapshot's migration plan
      description: |-
        Given a volume or snapshot, returns the migration plan but does not perform the actual migration. To perform the migration, you have to call the [Migrate a volume and/or snapshots to SBS](#path-volumes-migrate-a-volume-andor-snapshots-to-sbs-scaleway-block-storage) endpoint afterward.
        The endpoint returns the resources that should be migrated together:
        - the volume and any snapshots created from the volume, if the call was made to plan a volume migration.
        - the base volume of the snapshot (if the volume is not deleted) and its related snapshots, if the call was made to plan a snapshot migration.
        The endpoint also returns the validation_key, which must be provided to the [Migrate a volume and/or snapshots to SBS](#path-volumes-migrate-a-volume-andor-snapshots-to-sbs-scaleway-block-storage) endpoint to confirm that all resources listed in the plan should be migrated.

        Perform an action on an Instance.
        Available actions are:
        * `poweron`: Start a stopped Instance.
        * `poweroff`: Fully stop the Instance and release the hypervisor slot.
        * `stop_in_place`: Stop the Instance, but keep the slot on the hypervisor.
        * `reboot`: Stop the instance and restart it.
        * `backup`:  Create an image with all the volumes of an Instance.
        * `terminate`: Delete the Instance along with its attached local volumes.
        * `enable_routed_ip`: Migrate the Instance to the new network stack.

        The `terminate` action will result in the deletion of `l_ssd` and `scratch` volumes types, `sbs_volume` volumes will only be detached.
        If you want to preserve your `l_ssd` volumes, you should stop your Instance, detach the volumes to be preserved, then delete your Instance.

        The `backup` action can be done with:
        * No `volumes` key in the body: an image is created with snapshots of all the server volumes, except for the `scratch` volumes types.
        * `volumes` key in the body with a dictionary as value, in this dictionary volumes UUID as keys and empty dictionaries as values : an image is created with the snapshots of the volumes in `volumes` key. `scratch` volumes types can't be shapshotted.
