  title: Public Gateways API
  description: "Scaleway Public Gateways are building blocks for your infrastructure
    on Scaleway's public\ncloud. They sit at the border of Private Networks and provide
    access to/from other networks or the Internet. As well as this, Public Gateways
    offer a host of managed features and services to facilitate the management of
    resources in your Private Network, including NAT to map private IP addresses in
    the Private Network to the public IP address of the Public Gateway.\n\n(switchcolumn)\n<Message
    type=\"tip\">\nTo create and manage your Private Networks, check out the [VPC
    API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc).\n</Message>\n(switchcolumn)\n\n##
    Concepts\n\nRefer to our [dedicated concepts page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/public-gateways/concepts/)
    to find definitions of all terminology related to Public Gateways, including NAT,
    SSH bastion and more.\n\n(switchcolumn)\n(switchcolumn)\n\n## Quickstart\n\n1.
    Configure your environment variables.\n\n    <Message type=\"note\">\n    This
    is an optional step that seeks to simplify your usage of the Public Gateways API.\n
    \   </Message> \n\n    ```bash\n    export SCW_SECRET_KEY=\"<API secret key>\"\n
    \   export SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE=\"<Scaleway default Availability Zone>\"\n    export
    SCW_PROJECT_ID=\"<Scaleway Project ID>\"\n    ```\n\n2. **Choose a Public Gateway
    type**: Public Gateways come in different shapes and sizes, with different network
    capabilities and pricing. When you create your Public Gateway, you need to include
    the required Public Gateway type in the request. Use the following call to get
    a list of available Public Gateway offer types and their details:\n\n    ```bash\n
    \   curl -X GET \\\n        -H \"X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n        -H
    \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n        \"https://api.scaleway.com/vpc-gw/v2/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/gateway-types\"
    \  \n    ```\n\n3. **Create a Public Gateway**: run the following command to create
    a Public Gateway. You can customize the details in the payload (name, description,
    tags, etc) to your needs: use the information below to adjust the payload as necessary.\n\n
    \   ```bash\n    curl -X POST \\\n        -H \"X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY\"
    \\\n        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n        \"https://api.scaleway.com/vpc-gw/v2/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/gateways\"
    \\\n        -d '{\n            \"type\": \"VPC-GW-S\", \n            \"name\":
    \"my-new-gateway\",\n            \"tags\": [\"my-first-tag\", \"my-second-tag\"],
    \n            \"project_id\": \"'\"$SCW_PROJECT_ID\"'\"\n            }'\n    ```\n\n

    Valid values                  | \n    |-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n
    \   | type            | The type of Public Gateway (commercial offer type) to
    create. Use the Gateway Types endpoint to get a list of offer types. | Any valid
    offer type string, e.g. `VPC-GW-S` |\n    | name            | A name of your choice
    for the Public Gateway        | Any string containing only alphanumeric characters
    and dashes, e.g. `my-new-gateway`. |\n    | tags            | A list of tags to
    describe your Public Gateway. These can help you manage and filter your gateways.
    | A list of alphanumeric strings, e.g. `[\"my-first-tag`, `my-second-tag` |\n
    \   | project_id      | The Scaleway Project ID to create the Public Gateway in.
    | A valid Scaleway Project ID, e.g. `f5fe13a0-b9c7-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002` |\n\n
    \   **Note**: Further parameters are available, but for the purposes of this quickstart
    we have included only the essentials. See the `Create a Public Gateway` endpoint
    documentation below for full details of all possible parameters.\n\n4. **Get a
    list of your Public Gateways**: run the following command to get a list of all
    your Public Gateways.\n\n    ```bash\n    curl -X GET \\\n        -H \"X-Auth-Token:
    $SCW_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n        \"https://api.scaleway.com/vpc-gw/v2/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/gateways\"\n
    \   ```\n\n5. **Attach a Private Network to a Public Gateway**: run the following
    command to attach a Private Network to your Public Gateway, and make all the Gateway's
    services such as NAT available to the Private Network. You can customize the details
    in the payload to your needs: use the information below to adjust the payload
    as necessary.\n\n   <Message type=\"tip\">\n   If you haven't created a Private
    Network yet, see the [Private Networks](https://www/scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc/)
    documentation to learn how to do so. Ensure you retain the ID of the Private Network.\n
    \  </Message>\n\n    ```bash\n    curl -X POST \\\n        -H \"X-Auth-Token:
    $SCW_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n        \"https://api.scaleway.com/vpc-gw/v2/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/gateway-networks\"

    will set up the Public Gateway as a NAT gateway, masquerading traffic sent to
    it to the\n    outer internet to provide internet access to resources in the Private
    Network.\n\n    | Parameter       | Description                                         |

    \ | Any valid Private Network ID in the same Availability Zone as the Public Gateway,
    e.g. `548dbcc3-8b78-486f-a79a-c3f5a17642f9` |\n    | enable_masquerade     | Defines
    whether the gateway should masquerade traffic for the attached Private Network
    (i.e. whether to enable dynamic NAT) | A boolean value, e.g. `true` |\n\n    <Message
    type=\"note\">\n    Further parameters are available, but for the purposes of
    this quickstart we have included only the essentials. See the [Attach a gateway
    to a Private Network](#path-gateway-networks-attach-a-public-gateway-to-a-private-network)
    documentation below for full details of all possible parameters.\n    </Message>\n\n6.
    **Delete a Public Gateway**: run the following call to delete your Public Gateway.
    Ensure that you replace `<PUBLIC-GATEWAY-ID>` in the URL with the ID of the Public
    Gateway you want to delete.\n\n    ```bash\n    curl -X DELETE \\\n        -H
    \"X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"
    \\\n        \"https://api.scaleway.com/vpc-gw/v2/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/gateways/<PUBLIC-GATEWAY-ID>\"\n
    \   ```\n\n    The expected successful response is empty.\n\n    (switchcolumn)\n
    \   <Message type=\"requirement\">\n    - You have a [Scaleway account](https://console.scaleway.com/)\n
    \   - You have [created an API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
    and that the API key has sufficient [IAM permissions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
    to perform the actions described on this page\n    - You have [installed `curl`](https://curl.se/download.html)\n
    \   </Message>\n    (switchcolumn)\n\n## Technical limitations\n\nThe following
    limitations apply to Public Gateways:\n\n- A maximum of eight (8) Private Networks
    can be plugged into a single Public Gateway\n- Note that the Public Gateway takes
    some time to start up, and actions on it are\nimpossible unless it is in the `running`
    state. To check the current state of a Public Gateway, use the [Get a Public Gateway](#path-gateways-get-a-public-gateway)
    endpoint to get information for your gateway: the `status` field of the response
    will tell you if it is running or in another state.\n- For further information
    about Public Gateway limitations see our [dedicated documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/public-gateways/troubleshooting/gw-limitations/).\n\n\n##
    Technical information\n\n### Availability Zones\n\nPublic Gateways can be deployed
    in the following Availability Zones:\n\n| Name      | API ID                |\n|-----------|-----------------------|\n|
    Paris     | `fr-par-1` `fr-par-2` |\n| Amsterdam | `nl-ams-1` `nl-ams-2` `nl-ams-3`
    |\n| Warsaw    | `pl-waw-1` `pl-waw-2` `pl-waw-3` |\n\nThe Scaleway Public Gateways
    API is a **zoned** API, meaning that each call must specify in its path parameters
    the Availability Zone for the resources concerned by the call.\n\n\n## Going further\n\nFor

  description: |
    PAT (Port Address Translation) rules, aka static NAT rules, belong to a specified Public Gateway.  They define the forwarding of a public port to a specific device on a Private Network, enabling enables ingress traffic from the public Internet  to reach the correct device in the Private Network.
