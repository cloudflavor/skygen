  title: Load Balancer API
  description: "Load Balancers are highly available and fully managed [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/concepts/#instance)
    that facilitate the distribution of incoming traffic across multiple servers.
    Load Balancers allow you to scale your applications while ensuring their continuous
    availability, even in the event of heavy traffic. They are commonly used to improve
    the performance and reliability of websites, applications, databases and other
    services.\n\nA Scaleway Load Balancer has a **public IP address** which is always
    reachable: in the event of hardware failure it is rerouted to a backup Instance.
    The Load Balancer receives incoming traffic at this IP address, monitors the health
    and availability of its **backend servers** via **health checks**, and balances
    traffic load between all healthy and available backend servers. \n\nYou can create
    as many **frontends** and **backends** for each Load Balancer as you wish, with
    frontends configured to listen on defined ports and forward traffic to specific
    backends. You can also add **certificates** to frontends to enable secure, encrypted
    connections and facilitate SSL bridging or offloading. Backends can be configured
    to use your **protocol** of choice (TCP or HTTP) to connect to their backend servers.
    Additional features such as Access Control Lists (ACLs) and routes allow you to
    further configure the flow of traffic through your Scaleway Load Balancer.\n\n(switchcolumn)\n(switchcolumn)\n\n##
    Concepts\n\nRefer to our [dedicated concepts page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/load-balancer/concepts/)
    to find definitions of all Load Balancer-related terminology.\n\n(switchcolumn)\n(switchcolumn)\n\n##
    Quickstart\n\n**Requirements**:\nTo perform the following steps, you must first
    ensure that:\n- You have a [Scaleway account](https://console.scaleway.com/)\n-
    You have created an [API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
    and that the API key has sufficient [IAM permissions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
    to perform the actions described on this page\n- You have [installed `curl`](https://curl.se/download.html)\n\n1.
    Configure your environment variables.\n\n    <Message type=\"note\">\n    This
    is an optional step that seeks to simplify your usage of the Load Balancer API.\n
    \   </Message>\n\n    ```bash\n    export SCW_SECRET_KEY=\"<API secret key>\"\n
    \   export SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE=\"<Scaleway default Availability Zone>\"\n    export
    SCW_PROJECT_ID=\"<Scaleway Project ID>\"\n    ```\n\n2. Create a Load Balancer:
    run the following command to create a Load Balancer. You can customize the details
    in the payload (name, description, tags, etc) as you wish.\n\n    ```bash\n    curl
    -X POST \\\n      -H \"X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type:
    application/json\" \\\n      \"https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/lbs\"

    Technical information\n\n\n### Availability Zones\n\nLoad Balancers can be deployed
    in the following Availability Zones:\n\n| Name      | API ID                           |\n|-----------|----------------------------------|\n|
    Paris     | `fr-par-1` `fr-par-2`            |\n| Amsterdam | `nl-ams-1` `nl-ams-2`
    `nl-ams-3` |\n| Warsaw    | `pl-waw-1` `pl-waw-2` `pl-waw-3` |\n\nThe Scaleway
    Load Balancer API is a **zoned** API, meaning that each call must specify in its
    path parameters the Availability Zone for the resources concerned by the call.\n\n##
