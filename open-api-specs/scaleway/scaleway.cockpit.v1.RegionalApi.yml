  description: |-
    Scaleway's Cockpit allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you insights and context into their behavior. Cockpit also enables you to visualize your metrics, logs, and traces through a Grafana dashboard. With Cockpit, you can also push data from your Scaleway resources, if they are [integrated with Cockpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

    The Observability Cockpit provides you with two Prometheus Remote Write endpoints for pushing metrics and logs. You can push metrics with any `Prometheus Remote Write` compatible agent such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/) or [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).

    You can push logs with any Loki compatible agent such as [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/), [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/), [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/), [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/), or [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/introduction.html).

    Refer to the [Cockpit Global API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/global-api/) for information on how to perform Cockpit visualization actions such as retrieving your dashboard URLs, managing Grafana users, and synchronizing your data through Grafana dashboards.

    ## Quickstart

    1. **Configure your environment variables.**

        <Message type="note">
        This is an optional step that seeks to simplify your usage of the API.
        </Message>

        ```bash
        export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<API secret key>"
        export SCW_PROJECT_ID="<Scaleway Project ID>"
        ```
    2.  **Retrieve push URLs.**

        Retrieve your endpoints for metrics, logs, and traces from the [Data sources tab](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/dataSource) of the Scaleway console.
        The `metrics_url` is a domain that exposes a Prometheus-like API to manage metrics, and the `logs_url` exposes a Loki API to manage logs.

        - The Prometheus Remote Write endpoint to push your metrics is the following: `https://xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.metrics.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/api/v1/push`.
        - The Remote Write endpoint to push your logs is the following: `https://xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.logs.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push`
        - Traces have different endpoints depending on the [push path](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-push-traces/#retrieve-traces-push-paths) you use. The traces endpoint for the OpenTelemetry agent is: `https://xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.traces.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/otlp`.

    3. **Create your Cockpit token to push metrics, logs, and traces.**

        Find out [how to create your Cockpit token via the console](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token/) or run the following command to create it via the API.

        ```bash
        curl -X POST \
        "https://api.scaleway.com/cockpit/v1beta1/tokens" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
        -d '{
          "project_id": "<Scaleway Project ID>",
          "name": "token-name",
          "scopes": {
            "query_metrics": false,
            "write_metrics": true,
            "setup_metrics_rules": false,
            "query_logs": false,
            "write_logs": true,
            "setup_logs_rules": false,
            "setup_alerts": false,
            "query_traces": false,
            "write_traces": true
          }
        }'
        ```

        <Message type="important">
          Your Cockpit token's `secret_key` only displays once. Make sure that you save it. We strongly recommend that you only give the minimal amount of permissions to your token.
        </Message>

    4. **Configure the Grafana alloy agent.**

        Find out [how to configure the Grafana alloy agent](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-with-grafana-alloy/) to push your data to Cockpit.

    5. **Configure rules and alerts.**

        Upon creation, your Grafana instance is already configured by default with your logs and metrics data sources and with the alert manager data source. This means that you will be able to configure and manage advanced alerting rules, for metrics and logs, configure contact points and notification policies, from Grafana.

        To do so, [access your Grafana dashboard](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/) and read our [dedicated documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/configure-alerts-for-scw-resources/) to find out how to configure alert rules for Scaleway resources. Refer to the **External links** section of this page if you are not familiar with the alert manager or alert rules.

        <Message type="important">
         - Make sure that you select the `Scaleway Alerting` alert manager, as Scaleway does not support the `Grafana` alert manager.
         - Make sure that you create rules on the data source containing the data you wish to be alerted on rather than on Grafana. (`datasource-managed-alerts`)
        </Message>

    (switchcolumn)
    <Message type="requirement">

     - You have a [Scaleway account](https://console.scaleway.com/)
     - You have [created an API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and that the API key has sufficient [IAM permissions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to perform the actions described on this page
     - You have [installed `curl`](https://curl.se/download.html)
    </Message>
    (switchcolumn)

    ## Technical information

    ### Regional availability

    Scaleway's infrastructure is spread across different regions.
    Your Cockpit resources are available in the Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw regions (fr-par, nl-ams, pl-waw)

    ### Current supported endpoints

    Cockpit supports telemetry ingestion and querying using the following open-source technologies:

    - [Mimir](https://grafana.com/oss/mimir/) for metrics
    - [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) for logs
    - [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) for traces
    - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) for the alert manager

    Cockpit exposes a subset of their HTTP APIs so users can push, query, and manage telemetry data from Cockpit.

    Refer to the [dedicated documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-supported-endpoints/) to find out which API endpoints are supported by Cockpit for data source management.


    ### Troubleshooting

    Refer to our troubleshooting documentation if [your pusher does not support HTTP headers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/troubleshooting/pusher-does-not-support-custom-http-headers/) or if you want to [reset your Grafana password.](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/troubleshooting/resetting-grafana-password-via-the-api/)

    ## Technical limitations

    - Metrics and logs data is retained **31 days**. After this period, data older than 31 days is deleted.
    - The number of **active metrics time series** is limited to **250,000 per Cockpit** by default.
    - The number of **active log streams** is limited to **5000 per Cockpit**.
    - It is not yet possible to downsample metrics.

    - [Pushing metrics using Prometheus's agent mode](https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/11/16/agent/). Prometheus can be used in an "agent-mode" that can scrape local targets and forward them using remote-write. This is useful for scenarios where targets are exposed in a private network (like a VPN or a single host) but need to be forwarded outside of it.
