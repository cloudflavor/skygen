  title: Serverless Functions API
  description: |-
    Deploying applications to the cloud becomes simpler with Serverless Functions. Instead of provisioning and maintaining servers, you just need to install a "function" of your business logic on the Scaleway cloud platform. The platform executes this function on demand, managing resource allocation for you. If the system needs to accommodate a hundred simultaneous requests, it creates a hundred (or more) copies of your service. Conversely, if demand drops to two concurrent requests, it destroys the unneeded ones. You only pay for the resources your functions use when they need them.

    The benefits of Scaleway Serverless Functions include:

    * Saving money while code is not running, as functions are only executed when an event is triggered
    * Auto-scalability:
      * Scaling up and down automatically based on user configuration (e.g., min: 0, max: 100 replicas of my function).
      * Scaling to zero when the function is not executed, which saves money for the user and computing resources for the cloud provider.
    * Endpoint-only scaling.

    ### Deploying functions

    This page explains how to use the Scaleway Serverless Functions API, including a quickstart and the full API documentation. However, we provide [several methods to deploy functions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/functions/reference-content/deploy-function/).

    1. Configure your environment variables.
        ```bash
        export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<your secret key>"
        export SCW_DEFAULT_REGION="<choose your location (fr-par/nl-ams/pl-waw)>"
        export SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID="<your project ID>"
        ```
        <Message type="note">
          A namespace is a project that allows you to group your functions. Functions in the same namespace can share environment variables and access tokens, defined at the namespace level.
        </Message>

    2. Set the name for your namespace and set your Project ID.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST \
          "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/namespaces" \
          -H "accept: application/json" \
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
              name: your-namespace-name, \
              project_id: "$SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID", \
              environment_variables: \
                {
                  YOUR_VARIABLE: content
                } \
              }'
        ```
    3. Copy the `id` field of the response to use in the next steps. For the sake of simplicity, we will save the ID to a variable, which we will use in the following examples.
        ```bash
        export SCW_NAMESPACE_ID="<your namespace id>"
        ```

    4. Edit the POST request payload that we will use in the next step to create a function. Modify the values in the example according to your needs, using the information in the table to help.
          ```
          {
            "name": "string",
            "namespace_id": "string",
            "environment_variables": {
              "<key>": "string"
            },
            "min_scale": "integer",
            "max_scale": "integer",
            "runtime": "unknown_runtime",
            "memory_limit": "integer",
            "timeout": "2.5s",
            "handler": "string",
            "privacy": "unknown_privacy",
            "description": "string",
            "secret_environment_variables": [
              {
                "key": "string",
                "value": "string"
              }
            ],
            "http_option": "enabled"
          }
          ```

          | Parameter        | Description                                                        |
          | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `name`           | The name of your function |
          | `namespace_id`   | ID of the namespace in which you want to create your function |
          | `runtime`        | Your function's runtime, check the supported runtimes above |
          | `environment_variables` | **NULLABLE** Environment variables of the function. |
          | `memory_limit`   |**NULLABLE** Memory (in MB) allocated to your function, see the table of memory/CPU allocation above (increasing the memory limit will increase the cost of your function executions as we allocate more resources to your functions). |
          | `min_scale`      | **NULLABLE** Minimum replicas for your function, defaults to `0`, **Note** that a function is `billed` when it gets executed, and using a `min_scale` greater than 0 will cause your function to run all the time. |
          | `max_scale`      | **NULLABLE** Maximum replicas for your function (defaults to `20`), our system will scale your functions automatically based on incoming workload, but will never scale the number of replicas above the configured `max_scale`. |
          | `timeout`        | **NULLABLE** Holds the max duration (in seconds) the function is allowed for responding to a request |
          | `description`    | **NULLABLE** Description of the function. |
          | `handler`        | **NULLABLE** More details with examples in each language/runtime section below |

    Note that the meaning of the value set in `handler` will change depending on the `runtime` parameter:
    *  `Node`, `PHP` and `Python` runtimes: `handler` is the path to the function file, followed by the name of the function to call. For example, `src/handler.handle` specifies a function file at `src/handler.js`, `src/handler.php` and `src/handler.py` respectively, with a function called `handle`.
    * `Go` and `Rust` runtimes: `handler` is the path to the package containing the handler. For example, `my_handler` specifies that the function file is located in a `my_handler` directory. The functions must then be part of a `main` package, exposing a `main` function.

          <Message type="note">
            All parameters, except the ones marked with `nullable` are **required**.
          </Message>

    5.  Run the following command to create your function. Make sure you include the payload you edited in the previous step.
          ```bash
          curl -X POST \
            -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY"\
            "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/functions"\
            -d '{
                  name: function-name, \
                  namespace_id: "$SCW_NAMESPACE_ID", \
                  memory_limit: 128, \
                  min_scale: 0, \
                  max_scale: 20, \
                  runtime: node16", \
                  handler: handler.myHandler \
                }'
          export SCW_FUNCTION_ID = "<your-function-id>"
          ```

    6. Upload your code from the console or directly via the API. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/#how-to-upload-your-zip-file) for more information.

    7. Run the following command to deploy your function.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST \
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/functions/$SCW_FUNCTION_ID/deploy" \
          -d "{}"
        ```
        <Message type="note">
          The process may take some minutes, as we have to build your source code into an executable function (wrapped by our runtimes), and deploy it to the Scaleway cloud platform.
        </Message>

    8. Retrieve your function's HTTP(s) endpoint with the following command once your function has been properly deployed.
        ```bash
        curl -X GET \
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/functions/$SCW_FUNCTION_ID"
        export FUNCTION_ENDPOINT="<endpoint>"
        ```

    9. Call your function via its endpoint.
        ```bash
        curl -X GET "$FUNCTION_ENDPOINT"
        ```

    10. (optional) Connect to your [Cockpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/), and access the **Serverless Functions Logs** dashboard to see your logs.

    11. (optional) Destroy the namespace (along with all functions and cron jobs) by using the following call:
        ```bash
        curl -s \
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" -X DELETE "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/namespaces/$SCW_NAMESPACE_ID"
        ```

    (switchcolumn)
    <Message type="requirement">
      To perform the following steps, you must first ensure that:
      - You have a [Scaleway account](https://console.scaleway.com/)
      - You have created an [API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and that the API key has sufficient [IAM permissions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to perform the actions described on this page
      - You have [installed `curl`](https://curl.se/download.html)
      - You have [installed `jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to improve readability of the API outputs
    </Message>
    (switchcolumn)

    ## Technical information

    - Functions are fully isolated environments
    - Scaling to zero (save money and computing resources while code is not executed)
    - High Availability and Scalability (Automated and configurable, each function may scale automatically according to incoming workloads)
    - Different programming languages supported
    - Multiple event sources:
      - HTTP (request on our Gateway will execute the function)
      - CRON (time-based job, runs according to configurable cron schedule)
    - Integrated with the Scaleway Container Registry product
      - Each of your functions namespace has an associated registry namespace
      - All your functions are available as docker image in this registry namespace
      - Each version of your function matches a tag of this image

    ### Token management

    To get all tokens associated with a function:

    ```bash
    export SCW_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
    export SCW_DEFAULT_REGION="<Scaleway default region>"
    export SCW_FUNCTION_ID=<function_id_you_want_to_inspect>

    curl -X GET \
      "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/tokens?function_id=$SCW_FUNCTION_ID" \
      -H "accept: application/json" \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Tokens can only be read at creation time, and are not stored, hence they can not be retrieved if lost.
    </Message>

    To generate a token for a function:

    ```bash
    export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<API secret key>"
    export SCW_DEFAULT_REGION="<Scaleway default region>"
    export SCW_FUNCTION_ID=<function_id_you_want_to_add_token>
    export EXPIRE_AT=$(date -d "+90 days" +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z)

    curl -X POST \
      "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/tokens" \
      -H "accept: application/json" \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
          description:desc, \
          expire_at:"$EXPIRE_AT", \
          function_id:"$SCW_FUNCTION_ID"
          }'
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      `expire_at` is optional, and in this example is set to 90 days from today (see `EXPIRE_AT`). If you don't set `expire_at`, your token will never expire.
    </Message>

    To revoke a token you need to delete it:

    ```bash
    export SCW_ACCESS_KEY="<API access key>"
    export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<API secret key>"
    export TOKEN_ID=<token_you_want_to_delete>

    curl -X DELETE \
      "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/tokens/$SCW_ACCESS_KEY" \
      -H "accept: application/json" \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```

    ### Authentication

    By default, new functions are `public` meaning that no credentials are required to invoke functions.

    A function can be `private` or `public`. This can be configured through the `privacy` parameter.

    Calling a `private` function without authentication will return HTTP code `403`.

    ### Authentication for private functions

    A `private` function will:

    - Reject a call without an `X-Auth-Token` header, returning HTTP status Code `403`
    - Validate the token _before_ invoking your code if it is provided via the `X-Auth-Token` header

    For example, to execute a private function by providing a token using `curl`, you may run the following command:

    ```bash
    curl \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: <generated-token>" <your-function-host>
    ```

    ### Logs

    Functions logs are sent to the project's [Cockpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/).

    The **Serverless Functions Logs** dashboard allows you to see functions logs. You can perform complex queries using the **Explore** section of Grafana, and with LogQL queries:

    ```logql
    {resource_type="serverless_function"}
    ```

    Additionally, you can use the Grafana Loki endpoint (`https://logs.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud`) to query programmatically the functions logs using a [token](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token/).

    ### Pagination

    Most listing requests receive a paginated response. Requests against paginated endpoints accept two `query` arguments:

    - `page`, a positive integer to choose which page to return.
    - `page_size`, an positive integer lower or equal to 100 to select the number of items to return per page. The default value is `20`.

    Paginated endpoints usually also accept filters to search and sort results. These filters are documented along each endpoint documentation.

    ### Regions

    Serverless Functions is available in the Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw regions, which are represented by the following path parameters:

    * `fr-par`
    * `nl-ams`
    * `pl-waw`

    ## Technical limitations
    ### Supported runtimes and function lifecycle

    You can find all information about runtimes and functions in the [Functions' lifecycle reference page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/functions/reference-content/functions-lifecycle/).
