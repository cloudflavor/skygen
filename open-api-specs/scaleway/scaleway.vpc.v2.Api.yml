  description: "VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud
    on top of Scaleway’s shared public cloud. \n\nVPC currently comprises the regional
    Private Networks product. Layer 2 regional Private Networks sit inside the layer
    3 VPC. Private Networks allows Scaleway resources (Instances, Load Balancers,
    Managed Databases etc.) within a single region to be interconnected through a
    dedicated, private, and flexible [L2 network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer).\n\nYou
    can add as many resources to your networks as you want, and add up to eight (8)
    different networks\nper resource. This allows you to run services isolated from
    the public internet and expose them to the rest of your infrastructure without
    worrying about public network filtering.\n\n(switchcolumn)\n<Message type=\"note\">\nVPC
    v2 is now in **General Availability**. \n</Message>\n\n<Message type=\"tip\">\nCheck
    out our [IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/) to facilitate
    the management of IP addresses across your different Scaleway resources.\n</Message>\n(switchcolumn)\n\n##
    Concepts\n\nRefer to our [dedicated concepts page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/vpc/concepts/)
    to find definitions of all concepts and terminology related to VPC.\n\n(switchcolumn)\n(switchcolumn)\n\n##
    Quickstart\n\n1. **Configure your environment variables**\n\n    <Message type=\"note\">\n
    \   This is an optional step that seeks to simplify your usage of the API. See
    the [Technical information](#technical-information) section below for help choosing
    an Availability Zone and Region. You can find your Project ID in the [Scaleway
    console](https://console.scaleway.com/project/settings).\n    </Message>\n\n    ```bash\n
    \   export SCW_SECRET_KEY=\"<API secret key>\"\n    export SCW_DEFAULT_REGION=\"<Scaleway
    region>\"\n    export SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE=\"<Scaleway Availability Zone>\"\n    export
    SCW_PROJECT_ID=\"<Scaleway Project ID>\"\n    ```\n\n2. **Create a Private Network**.
    Run the following command to create a Private Network. You can customize the details
    in the payload (name, tags etc.) to your needs.\n\n    ```bash\n    curl -X POST
    \\\n        -H \"X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n        -H \"Content-Type:
    application/json\" \\\n        \"https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v2/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/private-networks\"
    \\\n        -d '{\n            \"name\": \"My new Private Network\",\n            \"project_id\":
    \"'\"$SCW_PROJECT_ID\"'\", \n            \"tags\": [\"test\", \"dev\"]\n        }'\n
    \   ```\n\n    <Message type=\"tip\">\n    Keep the `id` field of the response:
    it is your Private Network ID, and is useable across all Scaleway products that
    support Private Networks. It may be useful to you to export the Private Network
    ID as a new environment variable `export PN_ID=\"<Your Private Network ID>`\n
    \   </Message>\n\n    <Message type=\"tip\">\n    If you create a Private Network
    without specifying a VPC to create it in, the behavior depends on when you created
    your Scaleway Project. [Find out more](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/vpc/concepts/#default-vpc)\n
    \   </Message>\n\n3. **Attach a resource to your Private Network**. Each Scaleway
    product has its own API to interact with Private Networks. To attach an Instance,
    Managed Database, Elastic Metal server, Load Balancer or Public Gateway to your
    Private Network, see instructions in the documentation of the relevant product
    API. Here, we take the example of an Instance.\n\n    Use the following call to
    attach an Instance to your Private Network. Ensure you replace `<Instance ID>`
    with the ID of your Instance, and `<Private Network ID>` with the ID of your Private
    Network. Note that the Instance must be in an Availability Zone that is part of
    the region of your Private Network.\n\n    ```bash\n    curl -X POST \\\n        -H
    \"X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"
    \\\n        \"https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/servers/<Instance
    ID>/private_nics\" \\\n        -d '{\"private_network_id\": \"<Private Network
    ID>\"}'\n    ```\n\n    <Message type=\"tip\">\n    Keep the `id` field of the
    response: it is your Private NIC ID. It may be useful to you to export\n    the
    Private NIC ID as a new environment variable `export NIC_ID=\"<Your Private NIC
    ID>`.\n    </Message>\n\n    <Message type=\"tip\">\n    Keep the `mac_address`
    field of the response, as it will allow you to identify the Private NIC inside
    your Instance. If successful, a new network interface will appear inside your
    Instance, ready to be configured to transmit traffic to other Instances of the
    same network, with the MAC address returned by the API call.\n    </Message>\n\n4.
    **Confirm that the network interface has been plugged in**. To do this, connect
    to your Instance and run `dmseg`. You should see an output similar to the following:\n\n
    \   ```bash\n    [1579004.592869] pci 0000:00:05.0: [1af4:1000] type 00 class
    0x020000\n    [1579004.594835] pci 0000:00:05.0: reg 0x10: [io  0x0000-0x003f]\n

    \   [1579004.606383] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 0: assigned [io  0x1000-0x103f]\n    [1579004.607212]

    ens5: renamed from eth0\n    ```\n\n5. **Confirm the presence of the network interface,
    and confirm its name if several networks are plugged into your Instance**. To
    do this, run `ip -br link`. You should see an output similar to the following:\n\n
    \   ```bash\n    lo               UNKNOWN        00:00:00:00:00:00 <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP>\n
    \   ens2             UP             de:1c:94:44:d0:04 <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>\n
    \   ens5             DOWN           02:00:00:00:00:31 <BROADCAST,MULTICAST>\n
    \   ens6             DOWN           02:00:00:00:01:5b <BROADCAST,MULTICAST>\n
    \   ens7             DOWN           02:00:00:00:01:5e <BROADCAST,MULTICAST>\n
    \   ```\n\n6. **Configure the Instance's IP address**. DHCP is activated by default
    on new Private Networks, and automatically assigns IP addresses to resources on
    the network. If you have an older Private Network, [check whether DHCP is activated](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/)
    and either activate DHCP for automatic IP configuration, or [manually configure](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/reference-content/manual-configuration-private-ips/)
    the network interface on your Instance if necessary.\n\n\n7. **Delete your Private
    NIC**, which equates to unplugging your Instance from the Private Network. Use
    the following call. Ensure you replace `<Instance ID>` with the ID of your Instance,
    `<Private Network ID>` with the ID of your Private Network, and `<NIC ID>` with
    the ID of your Private NIC.\n\n    ```bash\n    curl -X DELETE \\\n        -H
    \"X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"
    \\\n        \"https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/servers/<Instance
    ID>/private_nics/<NIC ID>\"\n    ```\n\n    The network interface disappears from
    your Instance.\n\n8. **Delete your Private Network**. Use the following call.
    Ensure you replace `<Private Network ID>` with the ID of your Private Network.\n\n
    \   ```bash\n    curl -X DELETE \\\n        -H \"X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY\"
    \\\n        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n        \"https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v2/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/private-networks/<Private
    Network ID>\"\n    ```\n\n    <Message type=\"note\">\n    Private Networks must
    be empty to be deleted. Ensure you have detached all resources and deleted all
    reserved IPs from your network prior to deletion.\n    </Message>\n\n   (switchcolumn)\n
    \  <Message type=\"requirement\">\n    - You have a [Scaleway account](https://console.scaleway.com/)\n
    \   - You have created an [API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
    and that the API key has sufficient [IAM permissions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
    to perform the actions described on this page\n    - You have [installed `curl`](https://curl.se/download.html)\n
    \   </Message>\n    (switchcolumn)\n\n## Technical information\n\nVPC and Private
    Networks are available in the Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw regions, which are represented
    by the following path parameters:\n\n* `fr-par`\n* `nl-ams`\n* `pl-waw`\n\n##
    Technical limitations\n\nThe following limitations apply to Scaleway VPC:\n\n-
    Up to 250 resources can be attached to a Private Network.\n- A resource can be
    attached to up to 8 Private Networks.\n- The following resource types can be attached
    to a Private Network:\n    - Instances\n    - Elastic Metal servers\n    - Apple
    silicon\n    - Managed Inference\n    - Load Balancers\n    - Public Gateways\n
    \   - Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL\n    - Managed Databases for
    Redis (only at the time of resource creation)\n    - Kubernetes Kapsule (only
    at the time of resource creation)\n- The MAC address of an Instance in a Private
    Network cannot be changed.\n- Broadcast and multicast traffic, while supported,
    are heavily rate-limited.\n\n## Going further\n\nFor more help using Scaleway
