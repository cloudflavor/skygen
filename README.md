#### Project Skygen

Project Skygen is a work in progress. The initial proof of concept was generated by ChatGPT 5.2 and is, as expected, a hot mess. It is currently being refactored by humans and will improve over time.

Skygen is a tool for generating Rust SDKs from OpenAPI v3 specifications used by major cloud service providers. It currently supports Cloudflare, Exoscale, Hetzner, DigitalOcean, and Scaleway.

The goal is not to support arbitrary OpenAPI v3 specifications. Instead, Skygen includes provider-specific logic sufficient to generate correct and usable Rust SDKs for the supported CSPs.

```
skygen generate -c <config.toml> -i <spec.yaml|url> -o <output-dir>
```

Needs taplo-cli installed to format the resulting Cargo.toml file.
